<p>Chances are you have either visited the URL on my resume, or you have accidentally come across this blog. Either way, welcome! I am going to break this down into as much of a wiki as possible.</p>
<br>
<ul>To accomplish this I am going to detail the following in each room:
  <li>Enumeration of the room and my thinking process</li>
  <li>The attack style and what ever information I have learnt with sources</li>
  <li>Infiltration of the victims machine</li>
  <li>Privlege escalation and what ever informaton I have learn with sources</li>
  <li>The steps I would take to harden the system (prevent another infiltration to the machine)</li>
  </ul>
<br>
<p>I will also have a section of the tools and websites I frequent with information on how each tool works and examples of their use in corrosponding rooms.</p>
<br>
<p>I hope you enjoy the read and learn a little as you go. I can say that I have been learning, and am still learning, so much within the cyber secrity world.</p>
