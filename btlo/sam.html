		<h4><u>Description:</u></h4> 
			<p>SAM is a medium level defensive box that focuses on reading PCAP/PCAPNG files, using Linux commands to narrow down searches and using third-party binary Volatility2 to read memory dumps.</p>
			<br>
		<h4><u>Scenario:</u></h4>
			<p>Samuel (Sam) is a Neatnik, when it comes to cleanliness and hygiene. Find out if he also follows cyber hygiene. An incident has been reported stating “Sam has lost his SAM”. It's your job to figure out what has happened. You are provided with sysmon logs, network traffic, and a memory dump.</p>
		<br>
		
      <h4><u>What is the attacker IP, and what is the port that they got a reverse shell on?</u></h4>
		<p>Lets begin by looking at what files we have to investigate for this box:</p>
		<img src="../resources/.images/Sam/investigation_files.png" alt="investigation_files.png">
		<p>The README.txt file does not have anything further of interest. Lets start with this question. Lets start with looking through the PCAPNG file. To do this we need to right-click and select 'Open With "Wireshark (GTK+)"'. With that open we are presented with a list of saved packets:</p>
		<img src="../resources/.images/Sam/packets.png" alt="packets.png">
		<p>Well.... 140,973 different packets to sort. We could manually look through this, but I also like to have free time available for the family. We need to filter this a little by using the Wireshark filtering<sub style="vertical-align: top;"><a href=#filter>[1]</a></sub> options. But what do we filter for? We need to understand how reverse shells work. A reverse shell is a method used to send instructions from 1 machine to another, without having to log into that machine. This is a primary method used in by attackers to manipulate and control a machine. The initial way this is accomplished is connecting to a machine that may have firewall exceptions made within the network. Once this connection has been established and the machine modified, it is recommended the attacker looks at a more persistant way to keep the connection, but that is more for conent related to <a href="thm">Try Hack Me</a> or <a href="htb">Hack The Box</a>.</p>
		<p>So what ports may be open in a firewall? A common one most networks would allow is port 80 and 443. This is the port used for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). Without port 80 and 443 being allowed users would be unable to connect to any webpage on the internet, so it is a common port used by attackers to reverse shell into the machine, and a common way for users to unknowingly download malicious software onto their device. Please note that it may not be just port 80 or 443, but it is best to start there to help narrow down your search.</p>
		<p>With the information above, lets look at filtering for port 80 and reviewing what the user connected to, or who connect to the user. BUT NOW WE HAVE A NEW QUESTION! TCP or UDP? Well the safest bet is the reverse shell is using TCP due to its reliability. UDP, which may be possible, is highly unlikely due to the commands being dropped and it being an unstable connection. So we know we want to begin with filtering <b>TCP</b> connections on port <b>80</b>.</p>
		<img src="../resources/.images/Sam/filter_wireshark.png" alt="filter_wireshark.png">
		<p>4,427 packets. This may seem a lot, but it really isn't. We have just narrowed this search down to only 3.1% of all packets, and a lot of them are confirming a connection with SYN-ACK. So we can now start removing IP addresses we may see as well. We can do that by using the Wireshark filters helping to narrow this down further using either the 'Follow TCP Stream' feature or investigating each IP address online. As this is just a box it may not be as easy to look up the IP addresses as they could be using fake IP addresses and manipulating the logs for rabbit holes. This could also be true in a real life scenario, but I believe speed is of the essence in those cases and they wouldn't really waste their time unless they had already infiltrated and have a persistace foothold in place. But I could be wrong still as I am learning this subject.</p>
		<p>Once we have narrowed down the list a little I can see a particular IP address in question. I can confirm if this is the IP address we are looking for by using the TCP Stream feature:</p>
		<img src="../resources/.images/Sam/reverse_shell.png" alt="reverse_shell.png">
		<p>If you have read any of my previous walkthroughs, you know I don't like giving out the answer, but I can not see any other way of explaining my thinking method in achieving this answer. So I have given away the port, but the IP address will still remain hidden.</p>
